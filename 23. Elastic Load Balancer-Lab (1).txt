Elastic Load Balancer


ELB works only within region and not outside the region
ELB works with different AZ in same region.
For ELB to work with different regions, Route 53 is used.


Scenario:
Create two web servers in same region and different AZ.
Bind these two webservers in ELB. Check the result.

1. Create AWS Ec2 Linux instance, say web-1,in Oregon, us-west-2a.
2. Create AWS Ec2 Linux instance, say web-2, in Oregon, us-west-2b.
3. Connect to web-1 using mobax, log on with root user and
   configure webserver on it.
   	yum install  httpd -y
	chkconfig  httpd on
