AWS Roles Notes:
When policies are applied on an AWS Ec2 instance or AWS application
or service then it is called Role.
An IAM role is very similar to a user, in that it is an identity with 
permission and policies that determine what the identity can and 
cannot do in AWS.
Roles do not use username and password but they use access key and
secret key in order to use the services like ec2, lambda, s3, RDS,
autoscaling etc.
Scenario
 Suppose you had configured any server and now you want to upload the
data to s3 without any user interaction then if that ec2 instance is having
a role of s3 then it can automatically upload with the help of script
without user interaction.
