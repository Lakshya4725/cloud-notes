Virtual Private Cloud:
Amazon VPC is a network infrastructure architecture within the AWS cloud,
which closely resembles a traditional network. 
It isolates your network infrastructure under your account from 
others account, other wise all networks will conflict with each
other.
It is based on CIDR/VLSM subnet networking concept.
A user can create his own vpc which is highly customizable.
By default every region will have default VPC with predefined 
subnets in each zone. 
It acts like an extension of corporate network which can be 
accessed through VPN


10.0.0.0: Network address.

10.0.0.1: Reserved by AWS for the VPC router.

10.0.0.2: Reserved by AWS. The IP address of the DNS server is the base of the VPC network range plus two. For VPCs with multiple CIDR blocks, the IP address of the DNS server is located in the primary CIDR. We also reserve the base of each subnet range plus two for all CIDR blocks in the VPC. For more information, see Amazon DNS server.

10.0.0.3: Reserved by AWS for future use.

10.0.0.255: Network broadcast address. We do not support broadcast in a VPC, therefore we reserve this address.
