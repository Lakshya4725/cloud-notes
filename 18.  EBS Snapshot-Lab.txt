EBS Snapshot:

1. Create EC2 Windows instance say name: Win-VM-1 in Oregon region 
   in us-west-2a AZ
2. Create EBS volume of 2gb in us-west-2a, say name: 2gb2a.
3. Connect to windows instance using remote desktop.
4. Open disk management using command diskmgmt.msc.
5. Initially, you will see disk0 of 30 gb.
6. Go to EBS volumes, attach 2gb2a volume to your windows instance.
7. Go to disk management of windows instance, now you will a see new 
   disk 1 of 2gb available. Make it online.Once drive letter is available,
   create two folders say China and Korea in it.
8. Suppose we want to increase this 2gb volume. For that we have to 
   create a snapshot of 2gb2a volume.
9. To create snapshot, go to Volumes, select 2gb2a volume,go to 
   Action, select create snapshot.
10. In description box, give some descripion say snap-1-2gb2a.
11. Snapshot is point-in-time backup. Here since we created a snapshot
    of 2gb2a volume having two folders inside it i.e China and Korea, 
    this snapshot will contain those two folders.
12. Snapshots can't be attached directly to instances. To attach this 
    snapshot to instance, we have to create volume of this snapshot.
13. To create volume of this snapshot, go to snapshot service, select 
    option create volume. Here we can increase the size of the volume 
    too. Suppose we want to create a volume of 4gb. so in size mention 4gb.
14. Select AZ us-west-2a.
15. Once created, attach this volume to windows instance.
16. Go to disk management. make the disk online. Open the volume. 
    You will see two folders China and Korea inside it.
    Now this windows instance has two EBS volumes attached to it.
    2gb and 4gb.
17. Go to original 2gb EBS volume (Disk1). open it and create two more folders inside it.
    Say :Kenya and Nigeria.
18. Again take snapshot of this 2gb volume say snap-2-2gb2a.
19. Again go to Disk-1 i.e original 2gb EBS volume and create two more folders inside it
    say: Australia, NewZealand .
20. Again take a snapshot of this same 2gb EBS volume say:snap-3-2gb2a. 
21. Now go to windows ec2 instance. Open diskmanagement and make both 2gb and 4gb EBS volumes offline.
22. Go to EBS Volumes service, detach both the volumes from Windows instance.
23. Delete both the EBS volumes. Now we want to restore the deleted data from backup i.e snapshots.
    But we had not taken snapshot of 4gb EBS volume. So data inside it is gone.
24. Let us now restore the snap-3-2gb2a. To restore it, we have to first create EBS volume from the
    snapshot and then attach that volume to EC2 instance. We cant directly attach snapshots to ec2 
    instance.
25. Now go to snapshot service, select snapshot snap-3-2gb2a, click aAction and select create volume. 
    You can create volume of same size i.e 2gb or more size. Let us create volume of 4GB.
26. Once successfully created, go to Action and select Attach volume. Attach it to windows instance.
27. Go to windows instance, open disk management, make disk 1 of 4gb online. 
    Open the volume and you will see contents of snap-3-2gb2a inside it.
28.  Till now we created instances and EBS volumes in same region, Oregon and same AZ us-west-2a.
     Now let us create one Windows ec2 instance in Singapore region in AZ ap-southeast-1. 
     Copy any snapshot from oregon region say snap-1-2gb2a in Singapore region in AZ ap-southeast-1.
     Once snapshot is copied (after 10-15 min), create EBS volume from it in Singapore region,
     and then attach that EBS volume to your windows instance in Singapore region.
29. Go to snapshot service in Oregon region, select snapshot snap-1-2gb2a, click on Action and select Copy.
    Select Singapore region and ap-souteast-1 as destination for copying snapshot. It will take 10-15 min for copying operation.
    Once copied, select the snapshot in Singapore region, go to Action and select Create Volume. Let us create volume of 3GB.
30. Once the volume is successfully created, select the volume , go to aAction, and select Attach.
31. Attach this volume to your windows ec2 instance in Singapore region.
32. Go to your windows instance, open disk management, you will see disk-1 of 3gb. Make it online. 
    Open the volume you will see contents of snap-1-2gb2a i.e folders, China and Korea.
32. At the end, make disk-1 offline. Go to EBS volume service, detach volume from windows instance. Delete volume and delete copied snapshot
