EBS  Volumes and Snapshots:

 EBS Volumes:

EBS volumes are specific to their AZ.

An instance can have multiple EBS volumes attached.

These EBS volumes can be attached as well as detached from an instance 
without any data loss.

EBS volumes at one particular time can be attached to only one instance,
it cannot be used with two or more instances at the the same time.

EBS volume can be attached to an instance which is in same AZ, it cannot be attached
to an istance which is in another AZ.

EBS volume will have a Volume ID, which will be used by cloudwatch and 
other services.


EBS Snapshots:

Snapshots are used to take EBS point-in-time backup.

Snapshots are incremental backup of the EBS Volume.

Snapshots are region specific, where as volumes are specific to AZ.

EBS volumes cannot be increased directly through volumes.

To increase the size of EBS volumes first create the snapshot, then 
from this snapshot create the required size of volume.
