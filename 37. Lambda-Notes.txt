Lambda:

AWS Lambda supports code written in Node.js (javascript), 
python, java (java 8 compatible), and c#(.Net Core).
All calls made to AWS Lambda must complete execution within 300 seconds. 
The default timeout is 3 seconds, but you can set the timeout to any 
value between 1 and 300 seconds.
AWS Lambda offers you run code without provisioning or managing servers, where you
pay only for the compute time when the code is running.
Lambda is priced on a pay per use basis and there are no charges when
the code is not running. Lambda allows you to run code for any time of application 
or backend service with zero administration.
Lambda provides easy scaling and high availability to your code without
additional effort on your part, Lambda does not provide access to the 
underlying compute infrastructure.
Lambda is designed to process events within milliseconds.
Code components of Lambda are Lambda functions and event sources.
	An event source is the AWS service or custom application 
	that publishes events.
	Lambda function is the custom code that processes the events.
Lambda automatically integrates with Amazon Cloudwatch logs, creating a log group
for each Lambda function and providing basic application lifecycle event
log entries, including logging the resouces consumed for each use of that
function
