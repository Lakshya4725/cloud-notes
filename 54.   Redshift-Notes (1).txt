Redshift Notes:
Amazon Redshift gives you fast querying capabilities over structured 
data using familiar sql based clients and business intelligence (BI)
tools using standard ODBC and JDBC connections.
Columnar Data Storage:
	Instead of storing data as a series of rows, Amazon Redshift 
organizes the data by columns.
Unlike row-based systems, which are ideal for transactions 
processing, column-based systems are ideal for data warehousing and 
analytics, where queries often involve aggregates performed over large data 
sets.
Since only the columns involved in the queries are  processed and 
columnar data is stored sequencially on the storage media, column-based system
require far I/Os greatly improving query performance.
Queries are distributed and parallelized across multiple physical
resources.
Uses replication and continuous backups to enhance availability and
improve data durability and can automatically recover from node and
component failures.
Redshift only supports Single-AZ deplyoments.
Single Node:
Enables getting started quickly and cost effectively and scale up to a multi-node
configuration as the needs grow.
Multi Node:
Requires a leader node that manages client connections and receive queries,
and two or more compute nodes that store data and perform queries and 
computations.
Amazon does not provide any SQL client tools but they recommend SQL
workbench/J.

Though you cannot connect to your cluster using psql or any SQL IDE
that supports PostgreSQL or ODBC drivers.
