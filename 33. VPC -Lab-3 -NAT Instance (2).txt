NAT Gateway is used to access internet in private subnet.
But NAT Gateway is heavily charged.
To avoid billing, we can use NAT Instance instead of NAT Gateway,
provided we have less number of servers in private subnet and their need
to access Internet is also less.
In this lab, scenario is that you have your VPC (PuneVPC).
In that VPC, you have public and private subnet.
You have Internet gateway (PuneIGW) attached to PuneVPC.
You created route tables for public and private subnet.
You have two ec2 instances in public subnet and two in private subnet.
You have internet in public subnet through Internet Gateway.
If we want Internet, in private subnet, we have to place Nat-instance 
in Public subnet and add rule in route table of private subnet.
Once done, you will be able to access internet from any ec2 instance in private
subnet.

Steps:

1. Go to EC2. Select launch instance.
2. Click Community AMI.
3. In seach box type nat hvm.
4. Select amzn-ami-vpc-nat-hvm-2018.03.0.20210915.x86_64-ebs - ami-0644b8e2bd3e3f580.
5. Sometimes it goes to other paid t2 instances. 
   Make sure you select free tier only.
6. Click Next: Configure Instance Details.
7. In number of instance type 1.
8. In Network, select PuneVPC.
9. In Subnet, select pune-pub-subnet.
10. In Auto-assign Public IP, select Enable.
11. Click Next: Add Storage
12. Click Next: Add Tags
13. In tag, type NAT-Instance-PuneVPC
14. Click Next: Security Group
15. Click Add Rule, All Traffic, Source: Anywhere, Review and Launch.
16. In Boot from general purpose (SSD) click Next. Click Launch.
17. Go to services, VPC, Route Tables, Pune-Pvt-route.
18. Click Routes, Edit, Add another route.
19. In target, we have to add Nat-instance. But it will not appear there.
20. For that, select Nat-instance from ec2, click Action, Networking, 
    change source/destination check. Click Yes,Disable.
21. Now this NAT instance will be visible in Target field of Add rule 
    in Route Table.
22. Go to Route Tables,In Target, add Nat-instance and in destination 
    type 0.0.0.0/0
23. Go to any instance in private subnet and try to ping with
    any internet site say www.yahoo.com. You should ping with yahoo because
    of NAT instance.
